Practicing algorithms and tired of typing out the same simple structures? Writing code to generate sample trees eating up your time? 

Introducing... Something revolutionary! Extrordinary! .... Magical? I'm happy to bring you i-.....


# Tree Kit

Simple code kit to include into your c++ programs so you can jump straight into your algorithms. 

### Platforms

This code runs on MacOS, Ubuntu, and Linux4Tegra (L4T aka Ubuntu 14.04.)

#### Why L4T

I'm working on a parallel implementation of a binary search tree balancing algorithm using the Kepler based 192 core SoC. Note that I'm using the latest
GCC compiler and the -std=c++14 flag is required. 

### More to come.
